# Passenger-Flights-Planning-Model-Based-on-Airlines-On-Time-Performance-Data


Referring to the flight on-time performance dataset. Build a model using Decision Trees and Random Forests to help passengers plan their trips by predicting the delay of a desired flight.

The most important part is selecting the best fitting variables out of so many in the raw dataset. Those are the variables a passenger should provide to get a predicted delay. 

For example, a traveler might wish to check expected delay by providing departure airport, destination airport, day of week, time slot of the day,...etc (think of other variables or derived variables). Recall our class discussions on the related drills for this use case regarding framing the use case, selecting input variables and engineering the outcome variable representing delay.
